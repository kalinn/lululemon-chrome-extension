# lululemon-chrome-extension
A Google Chrome extention that checks the Lululemon sale site for my favorite items.

## To use:
1. Go to lululemon.com and find the names of your favorite items.  Edit the lulu.js file to include these items. To do this, change the text inside the /’s of the pattern variables to match the names of your items. You’ll immediately notice that you can add more or delete some; just make sure you change the “if” statement accordingly on the next line.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/ 
3. Click on “Load unpacked extension…” (if you don’t see this button, check the “Developer mode” box) and select the folder. Make sure “Enabled” is checked. 

Then click on the lululemon button to see if any of your favorite items are on sale!
